Remaking QUILTS in Python.

It's in its early stages, so half the lines are just me asking myself questions
that I will forget to answer in the future.

Also, trying to be super meticulous about checking input for correctness/existence.
Hold me to this in the future when I start to get lazy.

A possible Important Thing for the future: write something to status/log whenever SystemExit happens?

A definite thing for the future: making a script that will call this one, since these filepaths
are real unwieldy. Should be able to move various "does this file actually exist" checks to that script.

Another definite thing: change all merged_pytest to merged

Complications to watch out for when defining tryptic peptides: right now we assume the missed cleavages will account for substitutions that add/remove an R/K. Might be worth checking if this actually happens.

Variant Start Codons: Right now, if there's a SNP in the start codon, we just throw that out. At some point, perhaps we should go through and look for the next possible start codon, assuming the transcription will start from there, but honestly, that is probably just going to make a garbage protein, so we're ignoring it for the time being.

Right now, there are no proteins/peptides that have both an indel and some other variant, unlike the SAAVs where we have tryptic peptides with all possible combinations of variants. This will probably change in the future, but for now if you've got an indel that's all you get.

Am I ever going to get rid of duplicate tryptic peptides (peptides that show up in multiple proteins)? Maybe that can be a postprocessing step. Or maybe that's a search problem. There aren't very many.
